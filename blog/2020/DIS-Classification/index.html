We illustrate the difference among them by an example.</p> <p>We assume that a set of data items (or objects) with two attributes a1 and a2 is given. Assume the global model we are interested in is a classification (or as often said labeling) of the data items. In descriptive modeling we just know the data items, as indicated by the points in the 2-dimensional grid. A descriptive modeling technique, such as clustering, produces classes, which are not known in advance. For doing this it relies on some criteria that specify when two data items probably belong to the same class. Such a criteria is usually based on a similarity measure.</p> <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lialittis/lialittis.github.io/master/assets/img/DIS_Clustering.png" alt=""></p> <p>A predictive modeling technique, such as classification, starts from a given classification (or labeling) of data items. Using that classification of the dataset the classification method infers conditions on the properties of the data objects, that allow to predict the membership to a specific class. For example, the prediction could be based on a partitioning of the attribute values along each dimension, as shown in the figure on the right. There, first attribute a1 is partitioned into two intervals, and for each of the intervals a different partitioning of the attribute a2 is used to determine the regions corresponding to classes. Misclassifications may occur as seen in the example.</p> <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lialittis/lialittis.github.io/master/assets/img/DIS_Classification.png" alt=""></p> <ul> <li><strong>Given a dataset of objects described by attributes, build a model that assigns objects to a class (or label)</strong></li> </ul> <p>no class info -&gt; descriptive model(clustering) -&gt; describe classes based on similarity of attribute values</p> <ul> <li><strong>Given a dataset of objects described by attributes, build a model that assigns objects to a class</strong></li> </ul> <p>class info -&gt; predictive model(classification) -&gt; predict classes based on known attribute values</p> <h2 id="classification-problem">Classification Problem</h2> <p>Classification creates a <strong>global model</strong>, that is used for predicting the class label of unknown data.

It characterizes how well the classifier performs its job. Often we encounter a trade off between predictive accuracy and the speed and scalability of the method. Methods that achieve high accuracy tend also to be more expensive. As for clustering, also for classification noise and outliers can pose additional problems affecting accuracy. Finally, a very important criterion is the interpretability of the model. In many concrete applications, it is critical that humans are able to understand based on which criteria a classifier takes a decision, e.g. for accountability. Imagine a case, where an assurance policy is refused based on the decision taken by a classifier, and the client would oppose in court. Only with human-interpretable methods the decision could be argued for. However, the most powerful classifiers today tend to produce models that are very hard to interpret for humans, as they represent very complex functions.</p> <h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2> <p>If a classifier has 75% accuracy, it means that …</p> <p>A.

In a basic decision tree, <strong>at each level one of the available attributes is used to partition the data set based on the different attribute values</strong>. At the leaf level of the decision tree, the values of the class label attribute are found. Thus, for a given data item with unknown class label attribute, by traversing the tree from the root to the leaf according to its data values, its class can be determined by choosing the class label found at the leaf level. Note that in different branches of the tree, different attributes may be used for classification.</p> <p>A decision tree is constructed in a top-down manner, by recursively splitting the training set using conditions on the attributes. How these conditions are determined is one of the key questions for decision tree induction. After the decision tree construction, it may occur that at the leaf level the granularity is too fine, i.e., many leaves correspond to outliers in the data. Thus, in a second phase such leaves are identified and eliminated.</p> <p>The key problem in constructing a decision tree is thus to determine the attributes that are used to partition the data set at each level of the decision tree.</p> <h3 id="decision-tree-induction-algorithm">Decision Tree Induction: Algorithm</h3> <p><strong>Tree construction (top-down divide-and-conquer strategy)</strong></p> <ul> <li>At the beginning, all training samples belong to the root</li> <li>Examples are partitioned recursively based on a selected “most discriminative” attribute</li> <li>Discriminative power determined based on <strong>information gain (ID3/C4.5)</strong> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Partitioning stops if</strong></p> <ul> <li>All samples belong to the same class → assign the class label to the leaf</li> <li>There are no attributes left → majority voting to assign the class label to the leaf</li> <li>There are no samples left</li> </ul> <p>The basic algorithm for decision tree induction proceeds in a greedy manner. First the set of all data objects are associated with the root. Among all attributes one is chosen to partition the set. The criterion that is applied to select the attribute is based on measuring the <strong>information gain</strong> that can be achieved, or how much uncertainty on the classification of the data objects is removed by the partitioning.</p> <p>Three conditions can occur such that no further partitions can be performed:</p> <p>(1) all data objects are in the same class, therefore further splitting makes no sense,</p> <p>(2) no attributes are left which can be used to split. Still data objects from different classes can be in the leaf, then majority voting is applied.</p> <p>(3) no data objects are left.</p> <h3 id="example">Example</h3> <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lialittis/lialittis.github.io/master/assets/img/example_decision_tree.png" alt=""></p> <p>Based on this approach for attribute selection, we can now illustrate the induction of the decision tree. In a first step, age is chosen for a split. The partition 31..40 contains after the split only instances from one class, the positive class, thus for this branch of the tree the induction terminates.</p> <p>For the partition &lt;= 30 we find that the student attribute is the best to be chosen for further splitting. Further splitting makes no more sense, as the two resulting partitions, after splitting by the student attribute, are consisting of either positive or negative instances only.</p> <p>Similarly, for the partition &gt;40 we find that credit rating gives the largest information gain. As before, further splitting is no more needed, as the resulting partitions contain only positive respectively negative instances.</p> <h2 id="attribute-selection">Attribute Selection</h2> <h3 id="entropy">Entropy</h3> <p>At a given branch in the tree, the set of samples S to be classified has P positive and N negative instances</p> <p>The entropy of the set S is</p> \[H(P,N) = -\frac{P}{P+N}log_2\frac{P}{P+N} - \frac{N}{P+N}log_2\frac{N}{P+N}\] <ul> <li>Note:</li> </ul> <p>If P = 0 or N = 0, then H(P,N) = 0 -&gt; no uncertainty</p> <p>If P = N, then H(P,N) = 1 -&gt; maximal uncertainty</p> <blockquote> <p>The approach is based on an information-theoretic argument. Assuming that we have a binary category, i.e., two classes P and N to which objects in S have to be assigned, we can compute the amount of information required to determine the class, by H(P, N), the standard entropy measure, where P and N denote the cardinalities of the classes P and N. Given an attribute A that can be used for partitioning the data collection, we can calculate the amount of information needed to classify the data after the split according to attribute A has been performed. This value is obtained by calculating H(P, N) for each of the partitions and weighting these values by the probability that a data item belongs to the respective partition.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="example-1">Example</h4> <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lialittis/lialittis.github.io/master/assets/img/example_attribute_selection.png" alt=""></p> <p>We illustrate the attribute selection process now for our running example. Initially the data contains P = 9 positive instances and N = 5 negative instances. This results in an entropy of 0.94, i.e. 0.94 bits are required to decide the class of one instance. We compute next the entropies of all partitions that result from splitting all attributes. For example, if we split for Age, we obtain 3 partitions, each with a different distribution of positive and negative instances; and thus with different entropies.</p> <h3 id="information-gain">Information Gain</h3> <p>The information gained by a split can thus be determined as the difference of the amount of information needed for correct classification before and after the split. Thus we calculate the reduction in uncertainty that is obtained by splitting according to attribute A and select among all possible attributes the one that leads to the highest reduction. For our example we can conclude that it is best to split on attribute age.</p> <p>Next we compute the weighted sum of all entropies of the partitions in a split. The weights correspond to the probability of an instance falling into an element of the partition. Computing this for all attributes shows, that the attribute H results in the lowest entropy, i.e., leaves the lowest remaining uncertainty about the class membership of instances after the split.</p> <ul> <li>Computation</li> </ul> <p>Attribute A partitions S into $S_1, S_2, … S_v$ Entropy of attribute A is \(H(A) = \sum_{i=1}^v\frac{P_i+N_i}{P+N}H(P_i,N_i)\)</p> <p>The information gain obtained by splitting S using A is \(Gain(A) = H(P,N) - H(A)\) Choose the biggest information gain as the splited one.</p> <h3 id="q--a">Q &amp; A</h3> <p>Given the distribution of positive and negative samples for attributes A1 and A2, which is the best attribute for splitting?</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>A1</th> <th>P</th> <th>N</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>a</td> <td>2</td> <td>2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>b</td> <td>4</td> <td>0</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>A2</th> <th>P</th> <th>N</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>x</td> <td>3</td> <td>1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>y</td> <td>3</td> <td>1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Answer:[<font color:white="">A1</font>]</p> <h2 id="pruning-修剪">Pruning [修剪]</h2> <blockquote> <p>A common problem in classification is that a classifier may <strong>overspecialize and capture noise and outliers in the data</strong>[噪声和离群值对数据的影响], rather than <strong>general properties</strong>. One possibility to limit overspecialization would be to <strong>stop the partitioning of tree nodes when some specific criteria is met</strong> (e.g., number of samples assigned to the leaf node). A possible criterion is to <strong>stop partitioning when the majority of remaining samples falls into one class</strong>.

To measure the description cost a suitable metrics for the encoding cost, both for trees and data sets is required. For trees this can be done by suitably counting the various structural elements needed to encode the tree (#nodes, #test predicates, # arcs), whereas for explicit classification, it is sufficient to count the number of misclassifications that occur in a tree node.</p> <p>补充： 剪枝的目的是为了通过删除部分节点和子树，以避免“过度合适”/“过学习”，因为过学习将导致我们作出的假设的泛化能力过差。最小描述长度（MDL）准则表示，解释一组数据最好的理论，应该使下面这两项之和最下：</p> <ol> <li>描述理论所需要的比特长度；</li> <li>在理论的协助下，对数据编码所需要的比特长度。</li> </ol> <p>而决策树中的MDL应当是使得训练样本的大多数数据符合这棵树，其他的样本作为例外编码，使得下面这两项最小：</p> <ol> <li>编码决策树所需要的比特，它代表了猜想</li> <li>编码例外实例所需要的比特</li> </ol> <p>Let M1, M2, …, Mn be a list of candidate models (i.e., trees).

Therefore, a more efficient approach is needed.</p> <blockquote> <p>To avoid repeated resorting of data, for every attribute a separate and presorted table is kept. Once a split is chosen, we find two different situation. For the table that keeps the attribute that was used in the split, the table needs just to be partitioned into two subtables, maintaining the order. For the other attributes we have to select the subtables corresponding to the instances of the two partitions that have been formed. To that end a temporary hash table is constructed that allows to associate to each dataitem its partition. Then the attribute table is scanned and partitioned using the hashtable to decide for each entry to which partition it belongs. Note that in this approach, for continuous attributes, the resulting tables are again sorted as the order is preserved from the original table.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Idea: Presorting of data and maintaining order throughout tree construction</strong></p> <ul> <li>Requires separate sorted attribute tables for each attribute</li> </ul> <p>Updating attribute tables</p> <ul> <li>Attribute used for split: splitting attribute table straightforward</li> <li>Other attributes <ul> <li>Build Hash Table once associating tuple identifiers (TIDs) of data items with partitions</li> <li>Select data from other attribute tables by scanning and probing the hash table</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="example-3">Example</h3> <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lialittis/lialittis.github.io/master/assets/img/example_continuous_splits.png" alt=""></p> <p>In this example we demonstrate of how attribute tables are split, when a decision node is introduced in the decision tree.

Ensemble methods, which we will discuss in the following, learn several models in parallel, and combine then their predictions by voting or averaging. Stacking methods use more sophisticated techniques to combine model outputs, based themselves on learning methods. Finally, boosting learn models in sequence. In each step the samples of the training data are reweighted depending on whether they have been correctly classified.</p> <p>Idea</p> <ul> <li>Take a collection of simple or weak learners</li> <li>Combine their results to make a single, strong learner Types</li> <li>Bagging: train learners in parallel on different samples of the data, then combine outputs through voting or averaging</li> <li>Stacking: combine model outputs using a second-stage learner like linear regression[线性回归]</li> <li>Boosting: train learners on the filtered output of other learners</li> </ul> <h3 id="random-forests-algorithm">Random Forests: Algorithm</h3> <p>Random forests are an ensemble method based on bagging. The principle is very simple: K different decision trees are learnt in parallel from different (independent) samples of the data, and the classification is derived from a majority vote of the predictions.</p> <p>Learn K different decision trees from independent samples of the data (bagging); vote between different learners, so models should not be too similar</p> <p>Aggregate output: majority vote</p> <h4 id="why-do-ensemble-methods-work">Why do Ensemble Methods Work?</h4> <p>Here we give the argument why ensemble methods work: even if the individual classifiers are not very good (e.g. make 35% errors in prediction) their aggregate will be very strong. For example, if we have 25 classifiers, the probability that a majority of them, namely at least 13, make a wrong prediction is very small, namely 6%. In general, ensemble methods work well, if the individual models are better than random guessing. The figure illustrates the relation between the classification errors of individual classifiers and the aggregate classification accuracy.</p> <h4 id="sampling-strategies">Sampling Strategies</h4> <p>Two sampling strategies</p> <p>Sampling data</p> <ul> <li>select a subset of the data → Each tree is trained on different data</li> </ul> <p>Sampling attributes</p> <ul> <li>select a subset of attributes → corresponding nodes in different trees (usually) don’t use the same feature to split</li> </ul> <p>For random forests the main issue is the choice of the sampling strategy, i.e., the generation of samples that are used for learning the individual models. Specifically, it consists of two different sampling strategy. The first, sampling data selects from the original dataset a sample. Thus each decision tree is trained on a different sample of data. The second, sampling attributes selects from the attributes available to take a decision a random subset. Thus even if a tree would have been constructed in the same way up to a level, the continuation might become different due to attribute sampling (e.g. the optimal attribute in one tree is not available for splitting in the other tree).</p> <h4 id="algorithm-context">Algorithm context</h4> <ol> <li>Draw K bootstrap samples of size N from original dataset, with replacement (bootstrapping)</li> <li>While constructing the decision tree, select a random set of m attributes out of the p attributes available to infer split (feature bagging)</li> </ol> <p>Typical parameters</p> <ul> <li>m ≈ sqrt(p), or smaller</li> <li>K ≈ 500</li> </ul> <h4 id="illustration-of-random-forests">Illustration of Random Forests</h4> <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lialittis/lialittis.github.io/master/assets/img/illustration_random_forests.png" alt=""></p> <p>Random forests allow to learn much more complex functions than basic decision trees. This fact is illustrated in this visualization. For the same training data set different numbers of decision trees are constructed (rCART is a variant of decision trees). We observe that with increasing numbers of trees the decision boundaries become increasingly more complex and smoother, and thus a better separation among different classes can be achieved.</p> <h3 id="q--a-2">Q &amp; A</h3> <p>The computational cost for constructing a RF with K as compared to constructing K decision trees on the same data</p> <p>A. is identical</p> <p>B. is on average larger</p> <p>C. is on average smaller</p> <p>Answer:[<font color:white="">C</font>]</p> <h3 id="characteristics-of-random-forests">Characteristics of Random Forests</h3> <p>Random forests are a very popular method for classification due to the many advantages they offer. They are considered as the method of choice in cases where the data is dense, which means that the number of features is relatively low (in the thousands). Sparse data would be, for example, vector space representation of documents with very large vocabularies. In such cases, before applying a method such as random forests, a dimensionality reduction would have to be applied. This could be accomplished in the case of documents by creating a word embedding.</p> <p>Strengths</p> <ul> <li>Ensembles can model extremely complex decision boundaries <strong>without overfitting</strong> </li> <li>Probably the most popular classifier for <strong>dense data</strong> (≤ a few thousand features)</li> <li> <strong>Easy to implement</strong> (train a lot of trees)</li> <li><strong>Parallelizes easily, good match for MapReduce</strong></li> </ul> <p>More recently, in cases where large training sets are available or number of features is very large, deep neural networks exhibit better performance than random forests.</p> <p>Weaknesses</p> <ul> <li>Deep Neural Networks generally do better</li> <li>Needs many passes over the data – at least the max depth of the trees</li> <li>Relatively easy to overfit – hard to balance accuracy/fit tradeoff</li> </ul> <h2 id="references">references</h2> <p>Textbook</p> <ul> <li>Jiawei Han, Data Mining: concepts and techniques, Morgan Kaufman, 2000, ISBN 1-55860-489-8 References</li> <li>Leo Breiman (2001) “Random Forests” Machine Learning, 45, 5-32. </li> <li>Shafer, John, Rakesh Agrawal, and Manish Mehta. “SPRINT: A scalable parallel classifier for data mining.” Proc. 1996 Int.
