I am a first-year Ph.D. student at **[Security and Privacy (SPRITZ) research group](https://spritz.math.unipd.it/)** of [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/), advised by **Prof.[Mauro Conti](https://www.math.unipd.it/~conti/)**, collaborating with **Trusted System Security Lab** of Huawei Munich Research Center, supervised by Senior Technical Expert and Director **[Silviu Vlasceanu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silviu-vlasceanu/)**.

I obtained my first M.Sc. from École Polytechnique, IP-Paris, in Cyber Physical Systems, and my second M.Sc.(diplôme d'ingénieur) from Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace, in direction of Math and Computer Science. My first professional research project was at [Nomadic Labs](https://www.nomadic-labs.com/) in 2021 on Smart Contract of Tezos Blockchain, where I was fortunate to work with [Dr.Yann Régis-Gianas](https://yrg.gitlab.io/homepage/) and Dr.Richard Bonichon. Sooner, I focused more on Hardware Security and Machine Learning Security, then I finished my Master Thesis with [Dr.Laurent Gomez](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=QJv4B9EAAAAJ&hl=fr) at SAP Security Research Team and we eventually published a scientific paper with the content of my thesis.

My research interests are **System/Hardware Security**, **Trustworthy Systems** and **Heterogenous Computing**. I am highly receptive to engaging in Open Source Projects as well as any other compelling initiatives.
