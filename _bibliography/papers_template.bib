  abstract={With the adoption of IoT-like technologies, industrials aim to enhance the business value of their physical assets and improve their operational efficiency. However, IoT devices alone tend to strain enterprise systems with a sheer volume of unstructured and unfiltered data. To overcome this challenge, endowing (smart) devices with AI-based capabilities can significantly enhance enterprise system capabilities. However, deploying AI-based capabilities on potentially insecure edge hardware and platforms introduces new security risks, including AI model theft, poisoning, and data leaks. This paradigm shift necessitates the protection of distributed AI applications and data. In this paper, we propose a solution for safeguarding the Intellectual Property and data privacy of ML-based software. We utilize hardware-assisted Privacy Enhancing Technologies, specifically Trusted Execution Environments. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in the context of ML-based motion detection in CCTV cameras. This work is part of a co-innovation project with the Smart City of Antibes, France.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
