# Rust Basics(1)

## Anatomy of a Rust Program

- indent with four spaces, not a tab
- `println!` calls a Rust marco
- end the line with a semicolon(;)

## Compiling and Running Are Seperate Steps

Rust is an *ahead-of-time* compiled language.

## Cargo

Cargo creats a project in a new directory and initializes a new Git repository along with a `.gitignore`
file.

```
Note: Git is a common version control system. You can change cargo new to use a different version control 
system or no version control system by using the --vcs flag. Run cargo new --help to see the available 
options.
```
Cargo expects sources files to live inside the `src` directory and puts the binary in a directory named
`debug`.

- `cargo new`
- `cargo build`
- `cargo run`
- `cargo check`

### TOML(Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language)

It is Cargo's configuration format.

### Building for Release

`cargo build --release` compile the project with optimizations.

## Crate

A `crate` is a collection of Rust source code files. For example, the `rand` crate is a *library* crate,
which contains code that is intended to be used in other programs.

### external crates

The external crates are added into projects as dependencies. Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything
that dependency needs from the *registry*, which is a copy of data from `Crates.io`.

### Cargo.lock

If `Cargo.lock` exists, Cargo will use the versions specified there rather than doing all the work of
figuring out versions again, which lets us have a reproducible build automatically.

### update

```
cargo update
```

helps you to update a crate.

# Common Programming Concepts

## Variables and Mutability

By default, variables in Rust are immutable.

You would get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a value that is designated as immutable.

### Constants

Like immutable variables, but constants:
- don't accept mut syntax.
- use const keyword
- the type of the value must be annotated

### Shadowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

When you run it:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
```

But shadowing:
- we create a new variable
- we can change the type of the value

## Data Types

Rust is a statically typed language, it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

### Scalar Types

Four primary scalar types : integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans and characters.

#### Integer Types

Integer Literals in Rust

```
Number literals	Example
Decimal	98_222
Hex	0xff
Octal	0o77
Binary	0b1111_0000
Byte (u8 only)	b'A'
```

Integer Overflow

- In debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow and cause the program to `panic` at runtime.
- In release mode, Rust performs *two's complement wrapping* for the value, and the program won't panic.

#### Floating-point Types

Two primitive types : numbers with decimal points f32 and f64.

```
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

### Boolean Type

`true` and `false`

### Character Type

Four bytes in size and Unicode Scalar Value.

### Compound Types

#### Tuple

- a variety fo types
- a fixed length
- comma-separated list
- access a tuple element by using a period (.) followed by the index
- tuple without any values has a special name, *unit* : an empty value ()

```
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

```
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```
#### Array

- same type
- a fixed lenght
- comma-separated list
- access elements by using indexing

```
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let a = [3; 5]; // equal to [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];

}
```

Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap.

**Runtime error : invalid array element access:**
```
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!("Please enter an array index.");

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut index)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect("Index entered was not a number");

    let element = a[index];

    println!("The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}");
}
```
The program resulted in a runtime error at the point of using an invalid value in the indexing operation.
This check has to happen at runtime, especially in this case, because the compiler canâ€™t possibly know 
what value a user will enter when they run the code later.

## Functions

Functions are prevalent in Rust code.

Rust code uses *snake case* as the conventional style for function and variable names.

```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter. **Requiring type annotations in 
function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to 
figure out what type you mean**.

### Statements and Expressions

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression.

- Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- Expressions evaluate to a resultant value.

Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you
turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value. 

### Functions with Return Values

We must declare the return type after an arrow (->).

We need to have an expression as the return value. If not, there might be mismatched types error.

## Control Flow

### if Expressions

```
if condition {

} else {

}
```

Boolean is expected after `if`, Rust cannot automatically convert non-Boolean to Boolean types.

```
if condition {

} else if condition {

} ... {

} else {

}
```

Using too many `else if` expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more that one, you might
wnat to refactor your code. For example by `match`.

#### Using if in a let Statement

Because `if` is an expression, it could be used on the right side of a `let` statement.

```
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```

### Repetition with Loops

Loop is an expression.

```
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

#### Returning Values from Loops

```
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {result}");
}
```

#### Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops

We could specify a loop label so that we use with `break` or `continue` to specify that those keywords 
apply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop.

Note that, the `break` keyword cannot be followed by both a return value and a loop label at the same 
time. The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a block early, and it can be optionally followed 
by an expression to provide a return value for the enclosing function or block. However, it cannot 
be combined with a loop label.

The labels should be in format like : `'lable`.

#### Conditional Loops with while

```
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

#### Looping Through a Collection with for

```
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```

```
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
