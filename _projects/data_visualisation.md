# Introduction

The public transportation system of Switzerland is playing a big role in mobility system. People use the transportation system for different purposes: work commute, sport, travel, outdoor or mountain activities, so on. This is where the motivation of the project comes from: "Visualize the time and space dynamic data of transportation system of Switzerland and find interesting insights". 

The inspiration of the map comes from the ocean-ship map visualization by [Klin digital](https://www.shipmap.org/) team. We have found several life tracking applications for the transportation system, but more specifically the top view of the running different modes of vehicles in delta time has not yet implemented for Switzerland to our knowledge. To that end, we have visualized a Dynamic flow Map of moving vehicles in time and graphical interactive figures to get interesting insight about the system. The \textbf{overview} of the visualization is a process of interactive map in different map modes and graphical figures to answer several research questions. The target audience of the project is planned to include people who are interested in transportation system, network visualization, Switzerland and who are just curious about things in world. Will require some knowledge for the user to interact with the map functionalities and to understand the statistical figures.
